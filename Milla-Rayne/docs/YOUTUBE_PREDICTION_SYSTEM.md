## How It Works

### Data Collection

```typescript
// Tracked automatically when you watch a video
{
  videoId: "abc123",
  title: "Best Jazz Piano",
  query: "jazz music",
  timestamp: 1698363600000,
  channelName: "Jazz Central",
  category: "Music"
}
```

### Prediction Algorithm

1. **Time-based**: Matches current hour to your typical viewing patterns
2. **Query similarity**: Finds related searches based on keyword overlap
3. **Frequency ranking**: Prioritizes your most-watched topics/channels
4. **Recency weighting**: Recent watches influence predictions more

### Storage

- Keeps last **100 videos** in history
- Tracks aggregated preferences:
  - Top queries (sorted by frequency)
  - Top channels (sorted by frequency)
  - Top categories (sorted by frequency)
  - Time preferences (hour of day → frequency map)
