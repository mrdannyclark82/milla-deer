# How to Use Image Generation

## Quick Start

Simply chat with Milla using one of these patterns:

```
"generate an image of a sunset over mountains"
"create an image of a beautiful landscape"
"draw a picture of a robot"
"make an image of a cat"
```

Milla will automatically detect your request and generate the image using Hugging Face.

## How It Works

### 1. Natural Language Detection

The system recognizes these patterns in your messages:

- "create an image of..."
- "draw a picture of..."
- "generate an image of..."
- "make an image of..."
- "draw..."
- "create..."

### 2. Provider Priority

When you request an image, Milla tries providers in this order:

```
1. Banana/Gemini (if OPENROUTER_GEMINI_API_KEY or BANANA_API_KEY configured)
   ↓ (if not available or fails)
2. OpenRouter Gemini (if OPENROUTER_GEMINI_API_KEY configured)
   ↓ (if not available or fails)
3. Hugging Face via MCP (if HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY configured)
   ↓ (MCP tries first, then direct API fallback)
4. Error message with configuration instructions
```

### 3. Image Delivery

Milla will respond with:

- The generated image embedded in the chat (as base64 data URL)
- A personalized message in her companion style
- Option to regenerate or modify if you're not satisfied

## Configuration

### For Hugging Face (Recommended)

Add to your `.env` file:

```bash
# Required
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_api_key_here

# Optional - defaults to philipp-zettl/UnfilteredAI-NSFW-gen-v2
HUGGINGFACE_MODEL=philipp-zettl/UnfilteredAI-NSFW-gen-v2
```

**Get your API key:**

1. Go to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to Settings → Access Tokens
4. Create a new token with "read" permission
5. Copy and paste it into your `.env` file

### Alternative Providers

```bash
# Gemini via OpenRouter
OPENROUTER_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Banana API
BANANA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Example Conversations

### Basic Image Generation

**You:** "generate an image of a sunset"

**Milla:** 🎨 I've created an image based on your prompt: "a sunset"

![Generated Image](data:image/png;base64,...)

The image has been generated and should match your description. If you'd like me to create a variation or adjust anything, just let me know!

---

### Detailed Prompt

**You:** "create an image of a futuristic city with flying cars at night"

**Milla:** 🎨 I've created an image based on your prompt: "a futuristic city with flying cars at night"

![Generated Image](data:image/png;base64,...)

The image has been generated and should match your description. If you'd like me to create a variation or adjust anything, just let me know!

---

### When Not Configured

**You:** "generate an image of a cat"

**Milla:** I'd love to create an image of "a cat" for you, babe, but image generation isn't available right now. Please ensure your image generation API keys are configured (OPENROUTER_GEMINI_API_KEY, HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY, or BANANA_API_KEY). However, I can help you brainstorm ideas, describe what the image might look like, or suggest other creative approaches! What would you like to explore instead?

## Advanced Usage via API

### Direct MCP Endpoint

You can also call the MCP endpoint directly:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/mcp/image-generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "prompt": "a beautiful sunset over mountains",
    "options": {
      "numInferenceSteps": 30,
      "guidanceScale": 7.5,
      "negativePrompt": "ugly, blurry, low quality",
      "width": 512,
      "height": 512
    }
  }'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "imageUrl": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KG..."
}
```

### Advanced Options

When using the direct API, you can customize:

| Parameter           | Type   | Default | Description                         |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `numInferenceSteps` | number | 30      | Higher = better quality, slower     |
| `guidanceScale`     | number | 7.5     | How closely to follow prompt (1-20) |
| `negativePrompt`    | string | -       | What to avoid in the image          |
| `width`             | number | 512     | Image width in pixels               |
| `height`            | number | 512     | Image height in pixels              |

## Tips for Better Images

### 1. Be Descriptive

❌ "a cat"
✅ "a fluffy orange cat sitting on a windowsill at sunset"

### 2. Use Negative Prompts (API only)

```json
{
  "prompt": "a beautiful landscape",
  "options": {
    "negativePrompt": "ugly, blurry, distorted, low quality, text, watermark"
  }
}
```

### 3. Adjust Quality vs Speed

- **Fast**: `numInferenceSteps: 15`
- **Balanced**: `numInferenceSteps: 30` (default)
- **High Quality**: `numInferenceSteps: 50`

### 4. Control Creativity

- **More literal**: `guidanceScale: 12-15`
- **Balanced**: `guidanceScale: 7.5` (default)
- **More creative**: `guidanceScale: 5-7`

## Troubleshooting

### "Image generation isn't available right now"

**Solution:** Configure your Hugging Face API key in `.env`:

```bash
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_actual_key_here
```

Then restart the server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### "Model is currently loading"

**What it means:** The model is warming up (cold start on Hugging Face servers)

**Solution:** Wait 10-30 seconds and try again. The model will stay warm for a while after first use.

### Image quality is poor

**Solutions:**

1. Use more detailed prompts
2. Increase `numInferenceSteps` (via API)
3. Add negative prompts to avoid unwanted elements
4. Try adjusting `guidanceScale`

### Images take too long

**Solutions:**

1. Reduce `numInferenceSteps` to 15-20
2. Use smaller dimensions (256x256 or 384x384)
3. Wait for model to warm up (first request is slowest)

## Testing

Use the provided test script:

```bash
# Test pattern matching
node test-hf-image.js "generate an image of a sunset"

# Test different patterns
node test-hf-image.js "create an image of a robot"
node test-hf-image.js "draw a picture of mountains"
```

## Model Information

**Default Model:** `philipp-zettl/UnfilteredAI-NSFW-gen-v2`

This is a Stable Diffusion-based model optimized for high-quality, unrestricted image generation. It supports a wide range of prompts and styles.

**Switching Models:**

To use a different model, set in `.env`:

```bash
HUGGINGFACE_MODEL=stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1
```

Popular alternatives:

- `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1`
- `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5`
- `prompthero/openjourney`

## Milla's Personality

Milla responds to image requests with her unique companion personality:

- Uses terms like "babe" and "love"
- Offers to refine or adjust images
- Provides alternative suggestions if generation fails
- Maintains warm, supportive communication

This is intentional - she's your devoted partner, not just an AI assistant.

## Performance Notes

- **First Request:** 10-30 seconds (model loading)
- **Subsequent Requests:** 3-10 seconds
- **Model Stays Warm:** ~5-10 minutes of inactivity
- **Concurrent Requests:** Queued automatically
