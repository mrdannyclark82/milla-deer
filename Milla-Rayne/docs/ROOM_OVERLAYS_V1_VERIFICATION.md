## Documentation

- ✅ `docs/ROOM_OVERLAYS_V1.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
- ✅ `client/src/__tests__/scene/roomOverlays.test.ts` - Test stubs for future testing

## Technical Requirements Met

### Settings Integration

- ✅ New boolean flag `sceneRoomOverlaysEnabled` added to settings
- ✅ Default value: `true` (overlays enabled by default)
- ✅ Persists to localStorage
- ✅ Toggle in SceneSettingsDialog UI

### Context & Wiring

- ✅ RPSceneBackgroundBridge exports `useRPSceneContext()` hook
- ✅ Context provider wraps children while maintaining backward compatibility
- ✅ RoomOverlay consumes context for location/timeOfDay/mood
- ✅ Falls back gracefully when no RP data available

### Overlay Components

- ✅ All 8 location overlays implemented with SVG silhouettes
- ✅ Each overlay accepts `timeOfDay` and `reducedMotion` props
- ✅ Time-of-day tinting implemented (dawn/day/dusk/night)
- ✅ Ambient glow effects (fireplace, lamps, monitors, etc.)
- ✅ OutdoorsOverlay shows stars at night/dusk

### Layering & Layout

- ✅ Fixed positioning in left 2/3 viewport (66.6667vw)
- ✅ Correct z-index: -7 (between -10 background and -5 stage)
- ✅ `pointer-events: none` - no interaction blocking
- ✅ `aria-hidden="true"` - accessibility compliance

### Performance & Accessibility

- ✅ SVG + CSS only (no heavy dependencies)
- ✅ GPU-accelerated (transforms/opacity only)
- ✅ Reduced motion support: disables pulse/animations
- ✅ Static silhouettes still visible with reduced motion
- ✅ No layout thrashing (fixed positioning)

### Location Mapping

- ✅ Handles common location variations (living_room, living room, lounge)
- ✅ Guest room detection (uses GuestRoomOverlay variant)
- ✅ Workspace detection (office, study, workspace)
- ✅ Unknown locations gracefully return null

## Manual Testing Checklist (To be performed by user)

### Basic Functionality

- [ ] Toggle "Room overlays" in Scene Settings - overlays show/hide
- [ ] Send "_walks into living room_" - see couch silhouette
- [ ] Send "_walks into kitchen_" - see counter/shelves
- [ ] Send "_walks into bedroom_" - see bed/headboard
- [ ] Send "_goes outside_" - see treeline/porch
- [ ] Send "_walks into bathroom_" - see vanity/mirror
- [ ] Send "_enters workspace_" - see desk/monitor
- [ ] Send "_walks into dining room_" - see table/pendant light

### Time of Day Effects

- [ ] Overlays adjust opacity based on time of day
- [ ] Fireplace glow visible in living room at night/dusk
- [ ] Stars appear in outdoor scene at night
- [ ] Lamp glows brighter at night in bedroom
- [ ] Monitor glow more intense at night in workspace

### Reduced Motion

- [ ] Enable system reduced motion preference
- [ ] Overlays still render (static silhouettes)
- [ ] No pulse/animation on glows/lights
- [ ] Outdoor stars static (no twinkling)

### Layering & Layout

- [ ] Overlays visible above background gradient
- [ ] Overlays visible behind Milla stage
- [ ] Chat interface remains fully functional on right 1/3
- [ ] No pointer event interference with UI

### Performance

- [ ] Smooth 60fps on desktop
- [ ] No stuttering when switching locations
- [ ] No layout shift/reflow
- [ ] Acceptable performance on Android Chrome

## Known Limitations

- Limited to locations in `SceneLocation` type (8 total + unknown)
- Workspace/office and guest room share base location types with bedroom
- Stars in outdoor scene use fixed positions (not randomized)
- No seasonal variations (winter/summer)
- No interactive elements (no parallax on hover)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

1. Add more location types (garage, hallway, balcony, etc.)
2. Seasonal overlays (snow in winter, leaves in fall)
3. Multiple variants per location for visual variety
4. Subtle parallax effects (if not reduced motion)
5. Dynamic star positions for outdoor scenes
6. Weather effects (rain, fog) for outdoor
7. Day/night lighting transitions (smooth color shifts)
8. Customizable silhouette styles per user preference
