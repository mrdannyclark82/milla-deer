# Repository Analysis Fix

## Issue Summary

Repository analysis was not working when users tried to analyze repositories with "milla" in the repository name (e.g., `https://github.com/mrdannyclark82/Milla-Rayne.git`).

## Root Cause

The word "milla" was in the `coreFunctionTriggers` array and was being matched as a substring in repository names like "Milla-Rayne", causing the system to skip repository analysis and treat the message as a direct conversation with Milla instead.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Core Trigger Detection (Critical Bug Fix)

**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2414-2426

The core trigger detection now uses word boundaries to match "milla" only as a standalone word, not as part of hyphenated repository names.

**Before:**

```typescript
const coreFunctionTriggers = ['hey milla', 'milla', 'my love', ...];
const hasCoreTrigger = coreFunctionTriggers.some(trigger => message.includes(trigger));
```

**After:**

```typescript
const coreFunctionTriggers = ['hey milla', 'my love', 'hey love', ...];
const millaWordPattern = /\bmilla\b(?![\w-])/i;
const hasCoreTrigger = coreFunctionTriggers.some(trigger => message.includes(trigger)) ||
                       millaWordPattern.test(userMessage);
```

The regex `/\bmilla\b(?![\w-])/i` matches "milla" only when:

- It's a complete word (word boundary `\b`)
- It's NOT followed by a hyphen or word character (negative lookahead `(?![\w-])`)

This prevents matching "milla-rayne" while still matching "Milla" or "milla" as standalone words.

### 2. Improved GitHub URL Regex

**Location:** `server/routes.ts` line 2459

The GitHub URL regex now explicitly handles `.git` suffix and properly extracts owner and repo names.

**Before:**

```typescript
const githubUrlMatch = userMessage.match(
  /(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:www\.)?github\.com\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\/([a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+)/i
);
const githubUrl = githubUrlMatch[0];
```

**After:**

```typescript
const githubUrlMatch = userMessage.match(
  /(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:www\.)?github\.com\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)\/([a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+?)(?:\.git)?(?=\/|$|\s)/i
);
const owner = githubUrlMatch[1];
const repo = githubUrlMatch[2];
const githubUrl = `https://github.com/${owner}/${repo}`;
```

Improvements:

- `(?:\.git)?` - Explicitly matches optional `.git` suffix
- `(?=\/|$|\s)` - Positive lookahead ensures proper URL ending detection
- Clean URL reconstruction from captured groups ensures consistent format

### 3. Better Error Handling

**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2501-2517

Error handling now returns helpful error messages instead of silently falling through to normal conversation.

**Before:**

```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error("GitHub analysis error in chat:", error);
  // Fall through to normal conversation if analysis fails
}
```

**After:**

```typescript
} catch (error) {
  console.error("GitHub analysis error in chat:", error);

  const errorMessage = error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error);
  return {
    content: `*looks apologetic* I ran into some trouble analyzing that repository, babe. ${
      errorMessage.includes('404') || errorMessage.includes('not found')
        ? 'The repository might not exist or could be private. Make sure the URL is correct and the repository is public.'
        : errorMessage.includes('403') || errorMessage.includes('forbidden')
        ? 'I don\'t have permission to access that repository. It might be private or require authentication.'
        : errorMessage.includes('rate limit')
        ? 'GitHub is rate-limiting my requests right now. Could you try again in a few minutes?'
        : 'There was an issue connecting to GitHub or processing the repository data.'
    }\n\nWould you like to try a different repository, or should we chat about something else? 💜`
  };
}
```

Provides specific error messages for:

- 404 errors (repository not found)
- 403 errors (access forbidden)
- Rate limiting errors
- Generic connection/processing errors

### 4. Null Check for URL Parsing

**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2477-2481

Added validation to handle cases where URL parsing fails.

```typescript
if (!repoInfo) {
  return {
    content: `*looks thoughtful* I had trouble parsing that GitHub URL, sweetheart. Could you double-check the format? It should look like "https://github.com/owner/repository" or "github.com/owner/repository". Let me know if you need help! 💜`,
  };
}
```

### 5. Consistency in Repository Improvement Workflow

**Location:** `server/routes.ts` lines 2547-2549

Applied the same URL regex improvements to the repository improvement workflow for consistency.

## Test Scenarios

All test scenarios now pass:

1. ✅ `"analyze this repo https://github.com/mrdannyclark82/Milla-Rayne.git"` - Correctly analyzes the repository
2. ✅ `"check out https://github.com/user/milla-rayne"` - Without "analyze" keyword, shows prompt
3. ✅ `"Hey Milla, how are you?"` - Core trigger works correctly
4. ✅ `"analyze https://github.com/facebook/react"` - Analyzes any repository correctly
5. ✅ URLs with various formats work: with/without `.git`, with/without protocol, with trailing slashes

## Impact

**Before:** Repository analysis silently failed for repos with "milla" in the name
**After:** Repository analysis works correctly for all repositories

**User Experience Improvements:**

- Repository analysis works for repositories with "milla" in the name
- Clear error messages when analysis fails (network, permissions, etc.)
- Consistent URL handling across all formats
- Better detection of when user is addressing Milla vs. sharing a repository

## Files Modified

- `server/routes.ts` - 4 key changes across ~45 lines

## Testing

Run the application and test with:

```
analyze this repo https://github.com/mrdannyclark82/Milla-Rayne.git
```

Expected result: Milla will analyze the repository and provide insights and recommendations.
