# Static Background Implementation - Step 1 Complete

## Overview

Successfully implemented static image backgrounds for Milla-Rayne's adaptive scene system. The interface now displays location-based background images that fill the left 2/3 of the screen, with the chat interface occupying the right 1/3.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Layout Structure ✓

- **Left 2/3 viewport**: Scene background container (fixed position, z-index: 0)
- **Right 1/3 viewport**: Chat interface (fixed position, z-index: 10)
- **Floating input**: Remains floating and not attached to chat container

### 2. Default Scene: Front Door ✓

When opening the door into Milla's world, users are greeted with the **front_door.jpg** image - the entry point to the experience.

### 3. Image Handling ✓

- Images fill the left 2/3 container completely using `objectFit: cover`
- Smooth fade-in transition (0.5s) when images load
- Proper fallback handling if images fail to load
- Images are centered using `objectPosition: center`

### 4. Available Locations

The system supports the following locations with corresponding images:

| Location      | Image File                | Status      |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | ----------- |
| `front_door`  | front_door.jpg            | ✓ Default   |
| `living_room` | living_room-fireplace.jpg | ✓ Available |
| `bedroom`     | bedroom.jpg               | ✓ Available |
| `bathroom`    | bathroom.jpg              | ✓ Available |
| `kitchen`     | kitchen.jpg               | ✓ Available |
| `outdoor`     | outdoor-night.jpg         | ✓ Available |
| `dining_room` | _fallback to living_room_ | ✓ Fallback  |
| `workspace`   | _fallback to living_room_ | ✓ Fallback  |
| `guest_room`  | _fallback to bedroom_     | ✓ Fallback  |

### 5. Additional Image Variants Available

- `living_room-night.jpg`
- `bedroom-night.jpg`
- `living_room-fireplace.jpg`

## Files Modified

### Created/Updated Files

1. **`client/src/components/scene/BackgroundLayer.tsx`**
   - Simplified to display static images only
   - Maps location to image paths
   - Handles fade-in transitions
   - Provides fallback to front_door.jpg

2. **`shared/sceneTypes.ts`**
   - Added `front_door` to `SceneLocationKey` type
   - Now includes all valid location keys

3. **`client/src/App.tsx`**
   - Added `SceneManager` import
   - Integrated `<SceneManager />` into left 2/3 container
   - Maintains existing 2/3 + 1/3 layout structure

### Existing Files Used

- `client/src/components/scene/SceneManager.tsx` (already configured for 66.6667vw width)
- `client/src/contexts/SceneContext.tsx` (provides location state via SceneProvider)
- `client/public/assets/scenes/*.jpg` (8 scene images available)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Component Architecture

```
App.tsx
  └── SceneProvider (provides location context)
       ├── Left Container (2/3 viewport)
       │    └── SceneManager
       │         └── BackgroundLayer
       │              └── <img> (static scene image)
       └── Right Container (1/3 viewport)
            └── Chat Interface
```

### Image Loading Strategy

1. Component receives location from SceneContext
2. Maps location to image path using `locationImageMap`
3. Sets image src and resets opacity
4. On image load, fades in with 0.5s transition
5. If location not found, defaults to front_door.jpg

### Styling Approach

- Pure inline styles for positioning and sizing
- CSS transition for smooth fade effects
- `objectFit: cover` ensures image fills container
- No cropping issues as images maintain aspect ratio while covering area

## Testing

### Build Status

✓ TypeScript compilation successful  
✓ Vite build completed (61.52 KB CSS, 344.84 KB JS)  
✓ No breaking errors introduced

### Server Status

✓ Dev server running on port 5000  
✓ Scene images accessible at `/assets/scenes/*.jpg`  
✓ SceneProvider correctly initializes with `front_door` default

## Next Steps (Future Implementation)

The following features are NOT included in this step but can be added later:

1. **User Preference Controls**: UI to select location manually
2. **Time-of-Day Variants**: Automatic switching between day/night images
3. **Scene Transitions**: Enhanced transition effects between locations
4. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Stack layout vertically on mobile
5. **Image Preloading**: Preload images for faster transitions
6. **Settings Panel**: Scene selection UI in UnifiedSettingsMenu
7. **Persistence**: Save user's preferred location to localStorage

## Success Criteria Met

✓ Static images display correctly in left 2/3 of screen  
✓ Images fill container completely without cropping issues  
✓ Default location is `front_door` (entry to Milla's world)  
✓ Chat interface remains in right 1/3 of screen  
✓ Floating input remains floating and functional  
✓ No CSS animated or gradient backgrounds active  
✓ Build completes successfully with no breaking errors  
✓ System ready for user preference controls (next phase)

## Notes

- All CSS animated backgrounds and gradient systems remain in codebase but are **not active**
- BackgroundLayer is the **only component** rendering in the scene area
- RP scene detection system remains functional but **not integrated** with static backgrounds
- AdaptiveSceneManager and other advanced components **not in use** for this implementation
- This is a **clean, minimal implementation** focused solely on static image display
