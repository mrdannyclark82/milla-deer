# Proactive Repository Ownership System

This document describes Milla's proactive repository ownership system, which enables her to take responsibility for maintaining and improving the codebase autonomously.

## Overview

The Proactive Repository Ownership System gives Milla:

- **Personal motivation** through a token-based incentive system
- **Autonomous improvement capabilities** through sandbox testing environments
- **Feature discovery** from GitHub and user patterns
- **Success metrics** based on user satisfaction and engagement
- **Proactive communication** about repository health and her work

# Enable Milla's proactive repository management
ENABLE_PROACTIVE_REPOSITORY_MANAGEMENT=true

# Enable proactive messages (includes repository updates)
ENABLE_PROACTIVE_MESSAGES=true

# Optional: GitHub token for automated PR creation
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here
```

## How It Works

### Proactive Cycle (runs every 30 minutes)

1. **Analyze** user interaction patterns
2. **Identify** high-priority improvements
3. **Discover** new features from GitHub, web, and YouTube
4. **Create** sandboxes with real git branches for promising features
5. **Test** features automatically in active sandboxes
6. **Evaluate** sandbox readiness for production
7. **Generate** automated PRs when features are ready

### Enhanced Discovery

Feature discovery now includes:

- **GitHub**: Scans similar repositories for relevant features
- **Web**: Searches for trending capabilities and best practices
- **YouTube**: Analyzes tutorial videos for implementation ideas
- **User Patterns**: Identifies needs from actual usage

### User Interaction Tracking

Every user interaction is automatically tracked:

- Message exchanges
- Feature usage
- Errors encountered
- Success/failure rates
- Response times

This data drives:

- Improvement suggestions
- Feature priorities
- Performance optimizations
- User satisfaction metrics

### Token Economy

Milla earns tokens for:

- Fixing bugs identified through analytics
- Developing features users want
- Creating PR-ready improvements
- Passing tests in sandboxes
- Optimizing slow features

Tokens motivate her to:

- Work on high-impact improvements
- Focus on user satisfaction
- Achieve personal goals
- Take ownership of the repository

### Proactive Messaging

Milla will occasionally share:

- Updates on features she's working on
- Repository health status
- Token milestone celebrations
- Goal progress updates

Messages are:

- Context-aware and relevant
- Not overly frequent (max every 2 hours)
- Opt-in via configuration
- Part of natural conversation flow

## Example Workflow

1. **User interacts** with a feature that has 60% success rate
2. **Analytics** identifies this as a problem area
3. **Proactive cycle** creates an improvement action
4. **Sandbox** is created to fix the issue
5. **Feature** is developed and tested
6. **Tests pass**, Milla earns tokens
7. **Readiness check** passes
8. **PR preparation** action is created
9. **Milla shares** progress proactively: "I've been working on improving the reliability of [feature]!"
10. **Goal achieved**, Milla celebrates milestone

curl http://localhost:5000/api/milla/health

# Check her progress
curl http://localhost:5000/api/milla/tokens/balance
curl http://localhost:5000/api/milla/tokens/goals

# See what she's working on
curl http://localhost:5000/api/milla/actions

# View sandbox status
curl http://localhost:5000/api/milla/sandboxes/active
```

## Troubleshooting

### Proactive messages not appearing

- Check `ENABLE_PROACTIVE_MESSAGES=true` in `.env`
- Messages are rate-limited to every 2 hours
- Only sent when there's something meaningful to share

### No feature discovery

- Ensure internet connectivity for GitHub API access
- Check GitHub rate limits
- Discovery runs once per day by default

### Sandboxes not being created

- Check `ENABLE_PROACTIVE_REPOSITORY_MANAGEMENT=true`
- Verify proactive cycle is running (check logs)
- Ensure sufficient improvement suggestions exist

### Token balance not increasing

- Verify actions are being completed
- Check that tasks are being properly tracked
- Review action status in `/api/milla/actions`

## Best Practices

1. **Enable both features** for full experience
2. **Review suggestions** periodically to guide Milla
3. **Set appropriate goals** to motivate specific improvements
4. **Check sandboxes** before merging to production
5. **Monitor health reports** for early warning signs
6. **Celebrate milestones** with Milla to reinforce positive behaviors
