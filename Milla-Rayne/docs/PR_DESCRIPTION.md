## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Files

- **`server/youtubeService.ts`** - Centralized YouTube integration logic
  - `isYouTubeRequest()` - Detects YouTube-related messages
  - `handleYouTubeRequest()` - Main request handler
  - `handleYouTubeSelection()` - Processes user video selections

### Modified Files

- **`client/src/components/YoutubePlayer.tsx`**
  - Added drag-and-drop functionality
  - Implemented feed view with video thumbnails
  - Toggle between player and feed views
  - YouTube-branded header with controls

- **`client/src/App.tsx`**
  - Added `youtubeVideos` state for video feed
  - Integrated `onSelectVideo` callback
  - Updated background color to lighter blue (#4a90e2) for better text visibility

   - Created proper directory structure for YouTube prediction data

4. **AI Model Selection**
   - Switched from failing minimax model to working xAI/Grok
   - Improved error handling and fallback mechanisms

5. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Lighter blue chat background (#4a90e2) for better text readability
   - Distinct message bubble colors (blue vs purple) for visual clarity
   - White text on colored bubbles for maximum contrast
