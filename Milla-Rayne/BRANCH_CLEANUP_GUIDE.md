# Branch Analysis and Management Recommendations

## Current Branch Status

### Active/Current Branch

- **copilot/cleanup-branches-and-secure-info** - Current working branch for security cleanup

### Branch Categories

Based on the branch names, they fall into these categories:

#### 1. Automated Fix Branches (Should be DELETED)

These are automated fix branches that have likely been merged or are no longer needed:

- `alert-autofix-8`
- `alert-autofix-8.1`

#### 2. Feature Branches (Needs Review)

- **copilot/create-oauth-routes-server** - OAuth implementation
  - Status: Review if OAuth routes are in main branch
  - Action: Merge if features are not in main, otherwise delete

#### 3. Automated Fix/Copilot Branches (Should be DELETED if merged)

These appear to be automated Copilot fix branches with UUID or numeric identifiers. Most are likely already merged:

- `copilot/fix-0b3d6fe9-68ad-45b2-b9db-4fc45012d7e4`

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Actions (Cannot be done without GitHub credentials)

**Note**: The following actions require GitHub authentication which is not available in this sandboxed environment. You'll need to perform these manually.

#### 1. Delete Merged Fix Branches

All the `copilot/fix-*` and `alert-autofix-*` branches should be deleted if they've been merged. To check and delete:

```bash
# Check if a branch has been merged to main
git branch -r --merged origin/main | grep "copilot/fix"

# Delete a remote branch (do this after confirming it's merged)
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

**Recommended deletion list** (28 branches):

```bash
# Delete all fix branches at once (ONLY after confirming they're merged)
git push origin --delete alert-autofix-8 alert-autofix-8.1
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-0b3d6fe9-68ad-45b2-b9db-4fc45012d7e4
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-0d5029de-765e-49bb-8d75-f890a3463017
# ... (continue for all fix branches)
```

#### 2. Review Feature Branch

**copilot/create-oauth-routes-server**:

- Review the OAuth implementation
- If it contains features not in main branch, merge it
- If already merged, delete it

### Manual Review Required

Before deleting any branch, you should:

1. **Check merge status**:

   ```bash
   # See if branch is merged to main
   git log origin/main..origin/branch-name
   ```

2. **View branch changes**:

   ```bash
   # See what changes the branch has
   git diff origin/main...origin/branch-name
   ```

3. **Check PRs**: Look at closed PRs in GitHub to see if these branches were already merged

## Branch Naming Best Practices (For Future)

To avoid this situation in the future:

1. **Delete branches after merging**: Enable automatic branch deletion in GitHub settings
2. **Use meaningful names**: Instead of UUIDs, use `feature/description` or `bugfix/issue-number`
3. **Regular cleanup**: Schedule monthly branch cleanup
4. **Limit branches**: Keep only active development branches

## Cleanup Script

Here's a script you can run (after backing up) to clean up merged branches:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# cleanup-merged-branches.sh

# Fetch latest from remote
git fetch origin

# Get main branch (or master)
MAIN_BRANCH="main"  # Change to "master" if needed

# List all merged remote branches except main and current
echo "The following remote branches are merged and can be deleted:"
git branch -r --merged origin/$MAIN_BRANCH | \
  grep -v "$MAIN_BRANCH" | \
  grep -v "HEAD" | \
  sed 's/origin\///'

echo ""
echo "To delete these branches, run:"
echo "git push origin --delete <branch-name>"
echo ""
echo "Or to delete all at once (USE WITH CAUTION):"
echo "git branch -r --merged origin/$MAIN_BRANCH | grep -v '$MAIN_BRANCH' | grep -v 'HEAD' | sed 's/origin\///' | xargs -I {} git push origin --delete {}"
```

## Summary

- **Total branches found**: 30
- **Branches likely safe to delete**: ~28 (all fix/autofix branches)
- **Branches needing review**: 1-2 (feature branches)
- **Current working branch**: 1 (this branch)

## Important Notes

1. **Cannot delete remotely**: This sandboxed environment doesn't have push permissions to GitHub
2. **Manual action required**: You'll need to delete branches manually through GitHub UI or with proper credentials
3. **Review before deletion**: Always verify a branch is merged before deleting
4. **Keep recent history**: Consider keeping some recent branches if they might be needed

## Alternative: GitHub UI Method

The easiest way to clean up branches:

1. Go to: https://github.com/mrdannyclark82/Milla-Rayne/branches
2. Look for "merged" label on branches
3. Click "Delete" button next to each merged branch
4. Use "All branches" dropdown to see stale branches

**Status**: Branch analysis complete, manual cleanup required
**Next Steps**: Review and delete branches through GitHub UI with proper authentication
