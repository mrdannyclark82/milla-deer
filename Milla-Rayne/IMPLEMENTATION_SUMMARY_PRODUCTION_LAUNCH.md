## Known Limitations and Future Work

### Homomorphic Encryption:

- **Current**: Deterministic encryption (same plaintext → same ciphertext)
- **Future**: Explore truly probabilistic HE schemes for better security
- **Impact**: Current approach trades some security for searchability

### Sensor Service:

- **Current**: Polling-based sensor updates every 5 seconds
- **Future**: Event-driven updates for lower battery usage
- **Impact**: Slight delay in context updates

### Edge Agent:

- **Current**: Basic pattern matching for NLP
- **Future**: ML-based intent classification
- **Impact**: Limited natural language understanding

### Load Testing:

- **Current**: Simulated load, not real production traffic
- **Future**: Chaos engineering and production load testing
- **Impact**: May not catch all edge cases
