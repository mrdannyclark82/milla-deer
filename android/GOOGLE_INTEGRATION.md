# Google Integration in Milla-Rayne

## Overview

The Milla-Rayne project has **extensive Google integration** on the **server side**. When the Android app connects to the server (online mode), it gains access to all these Google services.

## 🔌 Current Status

### ❌ Android App (Standalone)

The native Android app **does not** include direct Google API integration. It:

- Uses only Gson (Google's JSON library) for data parsing
- Uses KSP (Kotlin Symbol Processing) from Google for code generation
- Connects to the Milla server which provides Google features

### ✅ Server Side (Full Google Integration)

The server has complete integration with Google's ecosystem:

## 📦 Google Services Available (Via Server)

## 🔄 How Android App Accesses Google Features

### Online Mode (With Server)

```
Android App → Milla Server → Google APIs
```

When connected to the server:

1. User asks: "What's on my calendar today?"
2. Android app sends request to Milla server
3. Server calls Google Calendar API
4. Server returns formatted response
5. Android app displays the information

### Offline Mode (Standalone)

```
Android App → Local Offline Generator
```

Google features are **not available** in offline mode. The app shows:

- "I need a server connection to check your calendar."
- "I can't access Google services in offline mode."

## 🚀 Adding Google Services to Android App

If you want to add direct Google integration to the Android app:

### Option 1: Google Sign-In (Recommended)

Add to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:20.7.0")
```

### Option 2: Firebase Integration

Add to `android/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
id("com.google.gms.google-services") version "4.4.0" apply false
```

Add to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
id("com.google.gms.google-services")

implementation(platform("com.google.firebase:firebase-bom:32.7.0"))
implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-analytics-ktx")
implementation("com.google.firebase:firebase-auth-ktx")
```

### Option 3: Google AI SDK (Gemini Direct)

Add to `android/app/build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
implementation("com.google.ai.client.generativeai:generativeai:0.1.2")
```

Then use Gemini directly in offline mode:

```kotlin
val generativeModel = GenerativeModel(
    modelName = "gemini-pro",
    apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"
)
```

## 📋 Implementation Checklist

To add Google services to the Android app:

- [ ] Choose integration method (Sign-In, Firebase, or Direct API)
- [ ] Add dependencies to build.gradle.kts
- [ ] Configure google-services.json (for Firebase)
- [ ] Add Google API keys to local.properties
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Add service-specific API calls
- [ ] Update offline mode to use local Google APIs
- [ ] Handle token refresh and expiration
- [ ] Update documentation

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**Current Setup (Server-Side):**

- ✅ API keys stored securely on server
- ✅ User credentials never exposed to client
- ✅ Rate limiting on server
- ✅ OAuth tokens managed server-side

**If Adding to Android:**

- ⚠️ Never hardcode API keys in APK
- ⚠️ Use Google Sign-In for authentication
- ⚠️ Store tokens in Android KeyStore
- ⚠️ Implement proper token refresh
- ⚠️ Use ProGuard to obfuscate code

## 💡 Recommendation

**For most users:** Keep using the server-based Google integration. It's:

- ✅ More secure (API keys on server)
- ✅ Easier to manage
- ✅ Better for rate limiting
- ✅ Centralized authentication

**For offline-first apps:** Consider adding Gemini AI SDK to enable AI features without server, but you'll need to:

- Manage API key securely
- Handle rate limits on device
- Pay for API usage per device

## 🎯 Current State Summary

| Feature         | Android App | Server | Status          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Gemini AI       | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Google Calendar | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Google Gmail    | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Google Drive    | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Google Photos   | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Google Tasks    | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Google Maps     | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| YouTube         | ❌          | ✅     | Via server only |
| Gson (JSON)     | ✅          | ✅     | Both            |

---

**Bottom Line:** The Android app accesses all Google services through the Milla server when in online mode. In offline mode, Google features are not available.
